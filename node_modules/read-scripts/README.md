# read-scripts

Utility CLI package that outputs the scripts in a package.json.
This is to avoid what I've always had to do, which is `cat package.json`, followed by scrolling up.

## Installation

`npm i -g read-scripts`

## Usage

Once you're in the directory containing the relevant package.json file, simply run
`read-scripts`
