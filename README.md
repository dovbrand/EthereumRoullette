### Testing (Back End)
Steps for testing the contract;

1. To begin the testing process, one must run the `testrpc` client from the terminal, which starts the server to connect the contract to the testing file.
2. Open a new terminal window and run `truffle develop` to deploy the contract.
3. Then use the command `test` to see all the available tests written in the javascript file.
4. There should be 13 available test files to view.
